# LaST
This repository contains the code and models for our paper "LaST: A Transformer-based Network for Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning with Dynamic Local Perception". The implementation is based on PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning frameworks.

# Status🔬:
The paper is currently under preparation and revision🥺. We are working hard to finalize our research and will release the full code upon publication. Stay tuned!

Expected Timeline:
- [x] [2024-11-13] Model Implementation
- [x] [2024-12-26] Experimental Results
- [ ] Paper Writing and Revision（仍在努力修改，我太菜了🥺Still working hard on the revisions, trying to learn how to write a good academic article🙀.）
- [ ] Code Release


# Quick Start🎇:
```shell
conda create -n last python=3.12
conda activate last
pip install lightning wandb opencv-python torchmetrics torchvision matplotlib rich ipykernel xarray netcdf4 cartopy
# pip install lightning wandb opencv-python torchmetrics torchvision matplotlib rich ipykernel xarray netcdf4 cartopy -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple
# python -m ipykernel install --user --name=last
```
