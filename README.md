# LaST
This repository contains the code and models for our paper "LaST: A Transformer-based Network for Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning with Dynamic Local Awareness". The implementation is based on PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning frameworks.

# Status🔬:

Our paper has now entered the peer-review process. We have diligently completed the writing and undergone multiple rounds of revision. We will also be continually uploading and updating non-core modules of the code. The full code will, of course, be released upon publication. Stay tuned!🫡

Expected Timeline:
- [x] [2024-11-13] Model Implementation
- [x] [2024-12-26] Experimental Results
- [x] [2025-02-17] Futher Analysis and Paper Writing
- [x] [2025-05-27] Paper Writing and Revision
- [ ] The paper is under review & We are organising and uploading partial code.
- [ ] Code Release
